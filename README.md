# EmbraceAI_FrontEnd

Welcome to the **EmbraceAI_FrontEnd** application, a dynamic Dash website designed to interface with an AI backend for emotion recognition and mindfulness exercise recommendation. This front end serves as a crucial component of a larger system that includes convolutional neural networks (CNNs), encoding models, and reinforcement learning (RL) models.

## Overview

The **EmbraceAI_FrontEnd** is part of our entry for the **TiDB Hackathon 2024**. It interacts with a sophisticated backend API that processes emotional data using CNN and encoding models to recommend mindfulness exercises via an RL model.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This application should be run within a virtual environment to manage dependencies efficiently.

### Virtual Environment Setup

To set up a Python virtual environment, follow these steps in your terminal:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### Usage
After launching the application, it should be accessible via a web browser. The interface allows users to input data which is then processed by the backend AI models to provide real-time feedback and recommendations.

### Features
Real-Time Data Processing: Connects with the backend to process emotional data through a CNN.
Mindfulness Recommendations: Uses an RL model to suggest personalized mindfulness exercises based on the user's emotional state.
Interactive Web Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface for real-time interaction and feedback.
Enjoy!
We hope you enjoy using the MindfulAI_FrontEnd. This application is a testament to the capabilities of integrating AI with web technologies to enhance user experiences in real-time scenarios.
